      "highlights": "Created a React Dashboard which connects to HP Siteflow API and allows users to view and manage printing devices. This was created to improve on searchability of devices since Siteflow's own dashboard takes a lot of time to navigate due to pagination and was championed by the IT team to manage 200+ devices. Wrote bash and Powershell scripts to automate tasks on Linux and Windows devices used within the Production line"
